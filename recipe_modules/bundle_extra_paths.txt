# We actually need to include essentially everything in this repo for recipes
# to work.
#
# The alternatives are:
#   * hard-code the bundle command to include the whole repo
#   * have the bundle command include the whole `recipes_path` folder by
#     default.
#
# The first alternative doesn't work for very large repos (like chromium/src),
# and the second one systemically prevents us from creating minimal recipe
# bundles. At least by awknowledging that we have so many includes we make the
# dependency explicit.
