Description:
Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, powered by urllib3, which is embedded within Requests.

Local modifications:
None.
